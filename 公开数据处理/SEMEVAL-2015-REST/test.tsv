1SERVICE#GENERAL	waitress	I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.
1SERVICE#GENERAL	waitress	I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."
1SERVICE#GENERAL	NULL	The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
1RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	NULL	We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.
1SERVICE#GENERAL	staff	Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.

1SERVICE#GENERAL	waiter	The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
1SERVICE#GENERAL	NULL	I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!
1SERVICE#GENERAL	waitress	The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
1SERVICE#GENERAL	NULL	I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.
1SERVICE#GENERAL	NULL	She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
1RESTAURANT#GENERAL	place	I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
